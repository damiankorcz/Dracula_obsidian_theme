I did not create the original Dracula Plus colour palette. Full credit for that
goes to the original [Dracula for Obsidian](https://github.com/jarodise/Dracula-for-Obsidian.md). I have selected
colours from the original theme, adjusted them, and added additional colours for
the purposes of adapting the theme to work with other apps e.g. Obsidian and Notion.
